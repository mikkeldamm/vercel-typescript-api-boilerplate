# Vercel Typescript API Boilerplate

This is a sample boilerplate project for creating simple api functions in Typescript hosted on the Vercel platform.

## What is Vercel?

Vercel is a cloud platform for static frontends and serverless functions. It enables developers to host websites and web applications that deploy instantly, scale automatically, and require no supervision.

## Prerequisites

You first need to install Vercel globally to be able to run the project and deploy it later.

```
npm install -g vercel
```

## Development

To run the api is as simple as running the following command in the root of the project:

```
vercel dev
```

The first time you run this command, it will ask you what projects on the Vercel platform that you would like to connect it with.

## Deploying

To deploy the project on the Vercel platform, you run the following command:

```
vercel
```
